/**
 * This package includes all information encapsulation techniques. They extend the class {@link algorithm.AbstractAlgorithm}.
 * If you want to plug-in your information encapsulation technique in the PeriCAT framework, then implement it similar to the existing techniques extending the abstract algorithm base class.
 * Afterwards add your class to the list of available techniques at the {@link main.Configuration} class.
