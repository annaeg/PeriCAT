# PeriCAT
The PERICLES Content Aggregation Tool is a framework for Information Encapsulation techniques developed during the PERICLES EU-project.

![PeriCAT](https://github.com/pericles-project/PeriCAT/blob/master/images/PeriCAT_slide_CCBY2.png)

The framework provides a set of Information Encapsulation techniques from different domains, and a decision mechanism to determine which of the techniques is the best one to use for a given user scenario.

PeriCAT is not published yet. It will be available here, expected in November 2015.

Have a look at the Wiki pages for further information.
